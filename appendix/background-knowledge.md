# Some background knowledge

In this section, we aggregate some basic background knowledge and jargons in the field of our project. This section could be served as a refresher for those who has left academia for a while and can't fully recall all the weary details and exact meaning of jargons in compiler course. Also, it would be a nice primer for those who didn't take such course and has interest in such field(and of course, our awesome WAMR project).

We think provide such section would be really nice so that you don't have to Google around. If there is anything you find inaccurate, you think should be included, or even better, you have something for us that you think would took this section to next level, do feel free to reach out to us on [Github](TODO:placeholder)!

Without further ado, let's dive right in our exciting recitation/learning journey!
